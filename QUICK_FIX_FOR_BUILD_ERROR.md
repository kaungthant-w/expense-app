# URGENT: Quick Fix for Build Error

## Problem
Your build is failing at line 312 in ContentView.swift with:
```
error: cannot find 'CurrencySettingsView' in scope
            CurrencySettingsView()
```

## Quick Fix (Copy and paste this exact change)

### Step 1: Open your ContentView.swift file in Xcode
- Navigate to `/Users/ipromise/Desktop/Desktop/v1/expense-app/hsu expense/ContentView.swift`
- Go to line 312

### Step 2: Find this code around line 312:
```swift
.sheet(isPresented: $showCurrencySettings) {
    CurrencySettingsView()
}
```

### Step 3: Replace it with this (comment out the CurrencySettingsView):
```swift
// Currency settings temporarily disabled until CurrencySettingsView is added to project
// .sheet(isPresented: $showCurrencySettings) {
//     CurrencySettingsView()
// }
```

## Alternative Quick Fix
If you can't find the exact code above, search for `CurrencySettingsView()` in your ContentView.swift file and comment out that entire `.sheet` block.

## After the Fix
1. Save the file (Cmd+S)
2. Try building again (Cmd+B)
3. The error should be resolved

## Why This Happened
The `CurrencySettingsView.swift` file exists but isn't added to your Xcode project target, so the compiler can't find it. This fix temporarily disables the currency settings feature until you can properly add the file to your project.

## Next Steps (After successful build)
1. Add `CurrencyManager.swift` and `CurrencySettingsView.swift` to your Xcode project
2. Follow the instructions in `add_currency_files_to_xcode.md`
3. Restore the currency features
