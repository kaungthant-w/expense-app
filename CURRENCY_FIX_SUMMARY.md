# Currency System Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Edit Expense Page Currency Issue
**Problem**: Edit expense page wasn't showing the current selected currency
**Solution**: 
- Updated `ExpenseDetailView` initialization to always use current currency from `CurrencyManager`
- Added `.onAppear` modifier to update currency when view appears
- Modified `saveExpense()` function to set expense currency to current selected currency

### 2. Removed Unnecessary Currency Indicators
**Problem**: Card view and expense row view had too many currency indicators
**Solution**:
- Removed "Current currency indicator" from Today's Summary card
- Simplified expense row view by removing:
  - Original currency price display
  - Currency flags 
  - Currency conversion indicators
- Kept only the converted price amount display

### 3. Myanmar Currency API Response Format Fix
**Problem**: API response format didn't match the expected structure
**Solution**: 
- Updated `fetchExchangeRates()` function to handle Myanmar API format:
  ```json
  {
    "data": [
      {
        "currency": "USD",
        "buy": "4480",
        "sell": "4380"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- Added proper parsing for the "data" array structure
- Implemented currency code mapping (JPN â†’ JPY)
- Added rate conversion logic for different currencies
- Added fallback rates for missing currencies

## Technical Changes Made

### ContentView.swift Updates:

1. **Today's Summary Card** (Line ~250):
   - Removed currency indicator display
   - Kept only the title "ðŸ“… Today's Summary"

2. **Expense Row View** (Line ~480):
   - Simplified price display to show only converted amount
   - Removed original currency display
   - Removed currency flags

3. **ExpenseDetailView** (Line ~962):
   - Updated initialization to always use current currency
   - Added `.onAppear` to sync with currency changes
   - Modified `saveExpense()` to use current currency

4. **CurrencyManager.fetchExchangeRates()** (Line ~1860):
   - Completely rewrote API response parsing
   - Added support for Myanmar API format
   - Implemented proper currency rate conversion
   - Added JPNâ†’JPY mapping

## Benefits

âœ… **Consistent Currency Display**: Edit page now always shows current app currency
âœ… **Cleaner UI**: Removed redundant currency indicators
âœ… **Working API Integration**: Myanmar Currency API now works correctly
âœ… **Real-time Updates**: Currency changes are immediately reflected in expense forms
âœ… **Better UX**: Users see current currency everywhere consistently

## Test Cases to Verify

1. Change app currency â†’ Edit expense â†’ Currency should match current selection
2. Check Today's Summary card â†’ Should not show currency indicator
3. Check expense list â†’ Should show only converted amounts, no extra currency info
4. Test API connection â†’ Should fetch real Myanmar exchange rates
5. Add new expense â†’ Should use current app currency

## API Response Example
The fix now properly handles this Myanmar API format:
```json
{
  "data": [
    {"currency": "USD", "buy": "4480", "sell": "4380"},
    {"currency": "EUR", "buy": "4858", "sell": "4685"},
    {"currency": "SGD", "buy": "3350", "sell": "3230"}
  ],
  "epoch": 1718952608.4546146,
  "timestamp": "2024-06-21 13:20:08"
}
```
